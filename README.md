# NOVEL2GRAPH
## A workflow to extract Knowledge Graph from literary text
### By [Mellace Simone](https://github.com/mellacsi), [Kanjirangat Vani](https://github.com/vanikanjirangat) and [Antonucci Alessandro](https://github.com/alessandroantonucci)
This pipeline is a semi-supervised algorithm, which receives a book as input and it discovers: the main characters, the main relations between characters, a Knowledge Graph including these information and more interesting material.
As final result, you will obtain an interface with which you can monitor and explore your results.

This work is based on [Temporal Embeddings and Transformer Models for Narrative Text Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08811), [Relation Clustering in Narrative Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13647) and [NOVEL2GRAPH: Visual Summariesof Narrative Text Enhanced by Machine Learning](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2342/paper4.pdf).


## Quickstart
- Clone the project
- Download the latest version of https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml#Download
- Unzip the downloaded folder `stanford-ner-20XX-XX-XX` and put it in `./libraries`
- The same as before following https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP#Quickstart
- Install requirements.txt
- Start test_static_dynamic_embedding.py and test_relations_clustering.py providing a book in txt format
- [Optional] Run test_relations_classifier.py or test_Bert_family_cls.py to discover more information about the book
- Run GUI/test_dash.py to start the interface on your machine


### Start
First perform the static and dynamic embedding of your book by typing:
```shell
$ python Code/test_static_dynamic_embedding.py myBook.txt
```
Secondly generate the Knowledge Graph of your book by typing:
```shell
$ python Code/test_relations_clustering.py myBook.txt
```
Finally run the interface to analyze and interact with your results:
```shell
$ python Code/GUI/test_dash.py myBook.txt
```

### Output 
Results are generated in *Data* folder, in particular this folder could contain these others sub-folders:
- *clust&Dealias/bookName/*: which for each book you run the algorithm with, contains the following files:
    - *bookName_occurrences.csv* contains a list of character names and occurrences;
    - *bookName_more_than_1.csv* as before but only with names occurring more than once;
    - *bookName_clusters.csv* contains all clusters (each row shows a cluster id, the contained names and the occurrences);
    - *bookName_out.txt* contains the coreferenced story in which originals names are replaced with an identifier ("CHARACTERX")
    - *\*.pkl* are cached data.
- *embedding*:
    - *embeddings* cache data containing the embedding of the book;
    - *models/bookName/chapters* contains dynamic and static models trained on the slices;
    - *slices/bookName/chapters* contains slices (text divided in chapters) which are use to train each model.
- *embedRelations/book/*:
    - *bookName_report_X.txt* contains all relations involving X characters;
    - *bookName_embeddings_X.pkl* contains embedded relations data;
    - *bookName_zero_char_sentences.pkl* contains sentences with 0 characters;
    - *bookName_few_char_sentences.pkl* contains sentences with fewer characters than desired (you can specify the desired amount in the code);
    - *bookName_right_char_sentences.pkl* contains sentences with the right number of characters than desired;
    - *bookName_more_char_sentences.pkl* contains sentences with more characters than desired.
- *family_relations*:
    - some material for relations extracted with *test_Bert_family_cls.py*
- *scraping/bookName*:
    - *amazon.csv*: a book's reviews from amazon books;
    - *goodreads.csv*: a book's reviews from Goodreads;
    - *librarything.csv*: a book's reviews from LibraryThing;
    - *wiki.csv*: a book's reviews from Wikipedia.
### Others
- Remember to use the Shift-Reduce Parser for Stanford CoreNLP from https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/srparser.html
- Some Stanford's extentions require Java x64 bit 
### Bugs fix
- To install Graphviz: ```$ sudo apt install python-pydot python-pydot-ng graphviz```
- To install mysql-config: ```$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev```
- To install resource stopwords (or punkt), please use the NLTK Downloader:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```
- Often it is useful to download: 
    - ```python -m spacy download en```
    - ```python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm```
